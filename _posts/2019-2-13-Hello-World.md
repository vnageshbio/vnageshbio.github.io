I thrive at the intersection of data science and biology, where I’ve spent over nine years diving into the fascinating world of bioinformatics and omics. My journey began with a solid foundation in biophysics and evolved into a passion for using computational tools to tackle some of biology's toughest puzzles. Every project I've worked on has been driven by my desire to contribute to advancements in therapeutics and diagnostics—it's thrilling to think that my work could have a real impact on people's lives.

Currently, as a Senior Data Scientist at Mammoth Biosciences, I’m fortunate enough to lead efforts around CRISPR-based gene editing tools. One of my proudest moments was when my team’s work contributed to a significant increase in the engagement of stakeholders with data tools by 50%. This experience taught me the value of collaboration and how diverse perspectives can lead to innovative solutions.

Before joining Mammoth Biosciences, I honed my skills at Arc Bio as a Bioinformatics Analyst where I played a key role in standardizing processes for next-gen sequencing projects aimed at identifying microbes in humans. My work helped streamline product launches and improve the accuracy of our analyses—contributing to an increase in our client satisfaction scores by 25%. Each role along the way has shaped my analytical abilities while deepening my understanding of biological systems.

My academic background includes dual Master’s degrees in Bioinformatics and Biophysics from San Jose State University and National Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences respectively. These experiences not only equipped me with technical skills but also instilled a lifelong love for continuous learning—whether it's through reading scientific literature or exploring new programming languages like R and Java.

Outside of work, I enjoy mentoring aspiring scientists through local workshops focused on bioinformatics techniques. It’s rewarding to share knowledge with others who are just starting their journeys; it keeps me grounded and reminds me why I fell in love with this field in the first place.
